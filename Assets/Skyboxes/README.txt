Hey!

This is a little skybox tester asset I've put together. 
It contains free skyboxes from the asset store, and a script I wrote to cycle through them easily.

Just open up the scene, press Left/Right arrow keys, and cycle through to your liking.
Remember the name of your favourite, and go look for it in the Resources folder.

*****************************************************

HOW TO USE:
Put all materials (not the texture!) - material! in the Resources -> SkyboxList folder.
The script will automatically import all of them into the scene.
